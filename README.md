# 🌮 The Little Taco Shop – HTML Practice Project

Welcome to **The Little Taco Shop**, a simple static website created as part of my journey to master HTML. This project focuses primarily on building structured, semantic HTML documents with minimal CSS styling. It's a hands-on exercise in writing clean, accessible, and well-organized markup.

- ✅ Practice and reinforce core HTML concepts
- ✅ Understand semantic elements and structure
- ✅ Build multi-page navigation using relative links
- ✅ Use common HTML elements like tables, images, lists, and forms
- ✅ Apply basic CSS for layout and visuals (only where necessary)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** (Primary focus)
- **CSS3** (Minimal, just for layout and presentation)
- No JavaScript (to stay focused on HTML fundamentals)
